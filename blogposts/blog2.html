          Have you ever come across the problem where your website looks too
          dull or too colourfull? Has it ever felt like your website is for
          nursery kids or for a circus promo? Do you wanna make your websites
          look more professional? Well, the answers for all those questions are
          right here in this blog, Read more to unravel it all...
        </p>
        <h2>1.No more than two fonts</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          Select a single font for your website, or atmost two and use this
          particular font for all of your website because two manypattern
          changes are not pleasing to the eyes. You may use diff text
          decorations and weights for minor changes, this looks more more sober
          and professional. This way you make readability of your website
          better.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h2>2.Set a color theme</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          You should always decide an eye catching color theme which is subtle
          as well at same time. Select a primary, secondary and tertiary color
          decide what color goes where, for example button has primary color and
          on hover it turns to secondary color. Always use a lilttle darker
          shade of white and a little lighter shade of black for bette
          aesthetics. Do not forget to pick lighter and darker shades of your
          primary color for minor color variations. An example of a really bad
          website is given below.
        </p>
        <div class="blog-img">
          <img src="badsite.png" />
        </div>
        <h2>3.Have proper spacing</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          I have seen many famous and professional websites commit this mistake,
          which is to shove features in the face of the app, button after button
          making it really difficult to find the features that I actually wanted
          to use. One such example of a bad site would be<a
            class="link"
            href="https://www.amazon.in/"
            style="font-weight: 900"
            >amazon's</a
          >official site. You should always make sure your website has
          aproppriate amount of blank spaces, this not only makes your website
          look beautiful but also makes it easy for the user to move around your
          site.
