          Well, you must have thought that how should a web developer start
          developing a website what key points should be kept in mind while
          creating a website. This blog is going to cover all of that for you
          and thus help you have a clearer mind while creating a website.
        </p>
        <h2>1.Note down the functionalities</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          One should be well aware about what functionalities their website is
          going to provide, which button does what, what all pages does the
          website contains, and which page can lead to which. All of this
          information must be very clear to the developer. This information can
          also be plotted using graph data structure pattern.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h2>2.Fulfil user's need</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          Developer should be well aware what the user is going to need and
          should take care of the user's experience. Should try to avoid
          redundant features and should always remember which features are
          absolutely important and must be kept no matter what.
        </p>
        <h2>3.Easy traversal</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          One thing which is extremely important is that, all of the important
          functions must be easy to find do you ever visit google and try to
          find "oh! where do I search stuff?". No, right? Because the search bar
          it's right there in front of your eyes. The user should be able to
          find his way through the website very easily.
        </p>
        <div class="blog-img">
          <img src="google.png" />
        </div>
        <h2>4.Site should load quickly</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          Your website should load as quickly as possible, lack of fast internet
          should never be a barrier for the users. Make sure that you are
          putting images in the needed resolution only, no need to put up HD
          images where they are not needed, also the css transitions should be
          minimised as much as possible. All of these things make your website
          hard to load and results in a bad user experience.
        </p>
